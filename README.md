# üåç Disaster Diary

**Disaster Diary** is a crowdsourced log of **human-centered stories** around landslides. Now more than ever, it‚Äôs important to humanize the data we engage with ‚Äî to talk about people, not just numbers on a screen.

This project offers an interactive way to both contribute and explore firsthand narratives of loss, survival, and resilience tied to landslide events across the globe.
[Data](https://maps.nccs.nasa.gov/arcgis/apps/MapAndAppGallery/index.html?appid=574f26408683485799d02e857e5d9521) for the map is sourced from The Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), which is a worldwide database of landslide events from NASA, scientists, and citizen scientists.
